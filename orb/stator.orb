* Stator


  Having gotten about as far as I can with mere string concatenation, it's 
time to put together a proper set of operations for transducing across a
Node. 

This isn't a great place to put theory, let's build the structure and 
flesh out from there.

#!lua
local Stator = setmetatable({}, {__index = Stator})
#/lua

#!lua
function call(stator)
	return setmetatable({}, {__index = stator, __call = call })
end
#/lua

#!lua
return setmetatable(Stator, {__call = call})
#/lua
