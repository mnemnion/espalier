# Espalier


`espalier` is a suite of tools for working with language, in the structured, formal and grammatical senses of the word.

It implements the `Node` class, for the representation and manipulation of (A|ST) trees in, currently, the PEG language as implemented by LPEG.

Full `GGG` format is comtemplated and if, say, Phillipe Janda would like to work on that, or maybe already y'know, has, that would be just peachy keen.

And thanks.

Y'all know the dril by now.
